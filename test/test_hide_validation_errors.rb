puts "Changes made to hide validation error display:"
puts "1. Modified _form_errors.html.erb to comment out the entire error alert div"
puts "   - The alert div with 'alert alert-danger' class is now disabled"
puts "   - No validation errors will be shown in the form"
puts "   - The div that showed '6 error prohibited this post from being saved:' is hidden"
puts
puts "2. The error display block that was commented out:"
puts "   - <div class=\"alert alert-danger\">"
puts "   - <h4>X error prohibited this post from being saved:</h4>"
puts "   - <ul> with list of error messages"
puts "   - </ul>"
puts "   - </div>"
puts
puts "Expected behavior after this change:"
puts "✓ No error alert div will be displayed when form validation fails"
puts "✓ Users will not see the red error box with validation messages"
puts "✓ The form will still prevent submission but without showing error messages"
puts "✓ JavaScript validation may still show individual field errors but no summary alert"
puts
puts "The validation error display has been completely hidden as requested!"
puts "The error alert div will no longer appear in the form."
