# Script to reproduce the image bug in post editing

# This script demonstrates the issue where:
# 1. A post has existing images attached
# 2. User adds new images via the form
# 3. The "Insert" buttons still show old image filenames instead of new ones

puts "=== Image Bug Reproduction ==="
puts "Issue: When editing a post with existing images, adding new images"
puts "causes the old image filenames to appear in markdown instead of new ones."
puts ""

puts "Expected behavior:"
puts "1. Post has existing images (e.g., 'old_image.jpg')"
puts "2. User adds new images (e.g., 'new_image.jpg')"
puts "3. Clicking 'Insert' buttons should show new image filenames"
puts ""

puts "Current bug:"
puts "1. Post has existing images displayed in the form"
puts "2. User selects new images - JavaScript adds markdown automatically"
puts "3. The existing image section still shows old image buttons"
puts "4. Users might click old image buttons, inserting old filenames"
puts ""

puts "Root cause:"
puts "The existing images section (lines 160-193 in _form.html.erb) is not"
puts "refreshed after new images are uploaded. The page shows both:"
puts "- Old image buttons (from server-side rendering)"
puts "- New image markdown (from JavaScript insertion)"
puts ""

puts "Solution needed:"
puts "After new images are uploaded via AJAX/JavaScript, the existing"
puts "images section should be refreshed to show the complete updated list."
